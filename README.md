## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- need to be more structured before starting to write code: look at all font-sizes, colors, etc and determine what styles are needed instead of looking them up all the time

### Continued development

- improve workflow
- overall, not too challenging
- next: build one more component with improved workflow

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://magenta-belekoy-ec1d11.netlify.app/#https://www.twitter.com) - This project helped me to see how to implement the display of the icon upon hovering over the image container
